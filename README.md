## The Project Itself

# [The Project Begins Here](project_notebook.ipynb)

# About the Data
This project uses the very popular Northwind Database, an SQL training database provided by Oracle for training.  The 
Northwind database is a sample database used by Microsoft to demonstrate the features of some of its products, including
SQL Server and Microsoft Access. The database contains the sales data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious specialty 
foods export/import company.

# About the project
An AB test is performed on the following hypotheses:
1) Discounts have a statistically significant effect on the number of products customers order.
2) There is a statistically significant correlation between the year and freight cost.
3) An order will cost the same regardless of which shipping company is used.
4) Each region spends roughly the same average price per order (+/- 0.03 x order_total)
